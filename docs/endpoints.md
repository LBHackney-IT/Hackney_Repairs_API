"limit": 10
},

### Fetch property by id

Return details of the given property

```
GET /v1/properties/:propertyReference/
```

#### Parameters

- propertyReference: (required) - the Id of the household to retrieve

#### Response

This should mostly mirror the individual results from the List properties by
ID endpoint, with the addition of the `maintainable` boolean. This is `true`
when `no_maint` in UH is `false`, and vice versa.

Properties with `maintainable = false` cannot have repairs raised against them.

"propertyReference": "00078345",
"problemDescription": "The fan is buzzing and sometimes not spinning at
all",

```
GET /v1/repairs/:repairRequestReference
```

#### Parameters

- Repair request reference (required)

#### Response

"problemDescription": "The fan is buzzing and sometimes not spinning at
all",
"priority": "N",
"contact": {
